# Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

This web browser quiz was created as practice for applying concepts combining knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web API's. The project serves as fundamental practice for front-end web development with multiple types of user-interactive elements and local storage.

## Usage

There are multiple elements to the page.

On the top left of the page, "View High Scores" will open a screen showing previous quiz results and scores.

On the top right of the page, the timer is displayed as 00:00 and will start at 60 seconds, counting down until the timer reaches 0.

In the center of the page, clicking the "Start Quiz" button will start the quiz.

4 answer choices will be given for each question. Selecting the correct answer will move the quiz to the next question. Selecting the incorrect answer will cause the timer to subtract time. There will be a notification that displays whether the answer was correct or incorrect.

When the quiz has ended at the end of the countdown timer, the final score screen will appear prompting the user to enter their initials. This score is based on the time left. Clicking the "Save score" button will save the user's score locally. Clicking the "Reset" button will erase the local score count.
